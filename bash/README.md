# Bash Extras/Add-ons

You can enrich your Bash by running:

```bash
cp _bash_extras ~/.bash_extras

echo 'source ~/.bash_extras' >> ~/.bashrc

# For some it will be:
# echo 'source ~/.bash_extras' >> ~/.bash_profile
```

The file `_bash_extras` contains adjustment to prompt and introduces new custom bash functions/utilities.
